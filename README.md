### All algorithms implemented in Python (for education)

These are for demonstration purposes only. There are many implementations of sorts in the Python standard library that are much better for performance reasons.

## Sort Algorithms


### Bubble
![alt text][bubble-image]

From [Wikipedia][bubble-wiki]: Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

* Worst case performance	O(n^2)
* Best case performance	O(n)
* Average case performance	O(n^2)
